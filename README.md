# Posts-Viewer

The application fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays posts and comments in a user-friendly layout. It allows users to view a list of posts and view comments related to each post. Users can search for posts by title.

## Features
